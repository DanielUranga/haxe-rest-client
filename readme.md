# Haxe restclient
A REST-ish wrapper around Haxe's built-in HTTP functionality

## Motivation
This library grew out of a logging client I created for another Haxe project. I could not find an existing haxelib that handled REST client functionality (most likely because Haxe's HTTP library is missing so much) so I threw together my own.

## Limitations
* The only verbs supported are GET and PUT

## Future
* Work around Haxe's limited HTTP verb support
* Haxe 3 support
